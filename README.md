*Homework 3*: using the Titanic Dataset, predict survivors using Decision Tree Classifier, GridSearchCV, and Random Forest Classifier 

*Homework 4*: using a Titanic Dataset, fit a neural network with the independent variables 'pclass + sex + age + sibspâ€™ and dependent variable 'survived'. Check the performance of the model with out-of-sample accuracy. Used scikit-learn.
